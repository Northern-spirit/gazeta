      		  		<h2>Investigations into the high-profile case continue</h2>
      		  		<img src="deadhous.jpg" width="375px">
      		  		<p>On the morning of may 13, 1985, the police arrived at the house. They showed arrest warrants for the four residents of the house and ordered them to leave peacefully. In response, the shooting started. In response, the police called for the help of 500 more police officers who opened heavy fire on the house. Tear gas bombs were thrown into the house. But the residents of the house did not give up and shot at everything they saw. Despite requests from the mayor and Senator to de-escalate the conflict, police Commissioner Gregor Sambor gave the order to blow up the house. </p><br>
      		  		<p> The mayor demanded to change his mind and even threatened to resign, but the Commissioner stood his ground. At 17: 28, a bomb consisting of C4 and a timer with a delay of 45 seconds was dropped from a police helicopter, directly on the roof of the house. There was an explosion and a fire started. Firefighters were afraid to approach the fire because of the targeted shooting. The fire spread to neighboring houses. As time passed, the fire spread to the entire block. By the time the fire was extinguished four hours later, the fire had consumed 61 homes. In addition to the woman and the 13-year-old who managed to escape, all the others died in the fire.</p><br>
      		  		<img src="bwost.jpg" width="375px">
      		  		<p>A total of 11 people were killed. This includes movement leader John Africa, five adult members of the group, and five children aged 7 to 13. Despite an investigation and an official apology, no one was charged.</p>

      		  	<h3>Fires</h3>
      		  	<br>
      		  	<p>In the Western half of the United States, wildfires are raging in the States of Oregon, California, Washington and Colorado due to heat, prolonged drought and strong winds. The fire threatens localities, and tens of thousands of residents have been evacuated. In addition, the environmental situation has seriously deteriorated.
On September 8, the most difficult situation was in Oregon. Because of the strong wind, gusts of which reached 120 km / h, there were many fires. The area of the two largest fires is 81 thousand hectares. Emergency evacuations were required in Marion, Douglas, Clackamas and lane counties. Also, 1,450 prisoners from three prisons were transported to safe places, according to Stormnews, citing Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB).
At least 100 structures were destroyed by fire in lane County. And in Marion County, where the sudden evacuation affected residents of the cities of mill city, Staton, Scots mills and Sablimity, there was a frightening phenomenon-because of the smoke of fires after the night remained dusk, settlements were shrouded in red haze, and the sun did not appear by noon.
